# Tech Evaluation Workflow

Systematically evaluate and assess new technologies, frameworks, or tools to make informed adoption decisions. This workflow takes you from initial technology discovery to implementation recommendation in 3-7 days, with clear decision frameworks and hands-on validation.

## 🎯 What This Workflow Achieves

**Primary Goal:** Make data-driven technology adoption decisions with confidence

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Clear go/no-go recommendation with supporting evidence
- ✅ Hands-on validation of key technology capabilities
- ✅ Integration feasibility assessment for your specific use case
- ✅ Risk analysis and mitigation strategies documented
- ✅ Implementation roadmap if adoption is recommended

**What This Is NOT:**
- ❌ Comprehensive technology survey or academic research
- ❌ Production implementation or full integration
- ❌ Vendor evaluation or procurement process
- ❌ Performance benchmarking across all possible scenarios

## 📋 Workflow Overview

### 5 Stages with Clear Deliverables

```
Stage 1: Problem Discovery (1-2 hours)
└── Deliverable: Technology Requirements + Evaluation Criteria

Stage 2: Landscape Investigation (2-4 hours)  
└── Deliverable: Technology Landscape Analysis + Shortlist

Stage 3: Hands-On Evaluation (4-8 hours)
└── Deliverable: Practical Assessment + Integration Experiment

Stage 4: Decision Planning (1-2 hours)
└── Deliverable: Comparative Analysis + Recommendation Framework

Stage 5: Implementation Roadmap (2-4 hours)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Clear understanding of the problem you're trying to solve
- Basic knowledge of your current technology stack
- Access to development/testing environment
- Stakeholder alignment on evaluation criteria and timeline

### Step 1: Set Up Your Evaluation
```bash
# Clone the workflows repository
git clone <ai-workflows-repo>
cd ai-workflows

# Create new evaluation from template
cp -r templates/tech-evaluation projects/my-tech-evaluation
cd projects/my-tech-evaluation

# Customize the evaluation context
# Edit evaluation-context.md with your technology and requirements
# Follow stage-by-stage execution
```

### Step 2: Execute the Workflow
1. **Start with Stage 1:** Define requirements and evaluation criteria
2. **Use AI collaboration:** Follow provided prompts for each stage
3. **Hands-on validation:** Actually use the technology, don't just research
4. **Make evidence-based decisions:** Document findings and reasoning
5. **Plan for adoption:** Create actionable implementation roadmap

## 📊 Decision Framework

### Technology Assessment Criteria
**Technical Fit:**
- Does it solve your specific problem effectively?
- How well does it integrate with existing systems?
- What are the performance characteristics?
- How mature and stable is the technology?

**Organizational Fit:**
- Does your team have the necessary skills?
- What are the learning curve and training requirements?
- How does it align with your technology strategy?
- What are the support and community resources?

**Business Fit:**
- What are the total cost of ownership implications?
- How does it impact development velocity and maintenance?
- What are the vendor/ecosystem risks?
- Does it provide clear business value?

### Decision Matrix
**✅ ADOPT - Strong recommendation to proceed:**
- Solves problem better than current solutions
- Acceptable integration and adoption costs
- Team has capacity and skills for implementation
- Clear ROI and business value

**🟡 TRIAL - Pilot implementation recommended:**
- Promising but needs validation in your environment
- Moderate risks but manageable
- Partial solution or specific use case fit
- Learning opportunity with limited downside

**🔴 AVOID - Do not adopt at this time:**
- Doesn't solve core problem effectively
- Unacceptable risks or adoption costs
- Team lacks capacity or required skills
- Better alternatives available
